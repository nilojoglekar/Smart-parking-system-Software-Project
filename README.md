# Smart-parking-system-Software-Project
The goal of the project is to solve the above mentioned problem statement, i.e. , to provide an effective
solution to the common parking problem and that it should be able to include further expansion and also
any other features or issues that can be addressed along with our solution.
Theidea is to deliver an interface (in our case a website) which the user can access to get the number of
parking slots available at a location so that he can be well aware in advance about the situation and by the
interface we are going to provide, he can find an alternative as it helps in finding out other nearby
locations.
